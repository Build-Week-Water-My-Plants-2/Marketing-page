# Marketing-page
This was a project that involved the heavy collaboration of teammates to essentially build a working app where users can create an account and manage their plants feeding time/watering time. The app takes in a user's data for plants (at least that is the concept behind it all) and then notifies the user proper feeding times for their plants in order to maintain the health and longeveity of various plants our users create. The app notifies the user through reminders and messages so that they are aware of the proper plant feeding times (again that is the concept not sure if all elements are working properly). My goal or objective for this project was to create the home page and the about page for the application for mobile, tablet, and desktop view and this design was to be based off a design concept of my choosing whether that be a template or something else. I was able to hit all the provided goals from the rubric provided as to my understanding of each individual goal. I correctly implemented the following Rubric Goals:

Rubric Item 1: HTML/CSS:
Student laid out the design that matches the example perfectly. CSS fundamentals such as: box model, flexbox, and positioning were used appropriately.

Rubric Item 2: Responsiveness
Phone views look professional at 500px and below and Desktop views look professional at 1000px and above. No horizontal scrollbars exist. Tablet views look professional at 800px and above. Responsive units are used for font-sizing.


Rubric Item 3: PreProcessing
Student's code is easy to read, they have used different less files for different portions of the site and they have imported them successful into the index.less file, student uses mixins and variables, student has used escaping for media queries, student writes DRY code and as used reusable parametric mixins with parameter names that make sense

Rubric Item 4: JavaScript Fundamentals
(I did implement a Javascript file of which I did not write, I was told we were not supposed to worry about Javascript.)

If you are new to web development than i have simplified things by simply adding a link below to the hosted site instead of making you dig through the folders and finding the index.html file so that you may view the webpage properly, in which you would have to first download all the corresponding folders. So below is the link to the site:
